# Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages 

`bitovi/github-actions-storybook-to-github-pages` builds and deploys a Storybook application to GitHub Pages.

This action uses the new GitHub Actions publishing method which allows you to create an artifact that contains the result of the build and serves the files in the artifact on the Pages site. Thereâ€™s no need to check files back into your repository, keeping it nice and clean.


## You are here
This action deploys Storybook to Github Pages.  The build process should create static files and put them into a build direcory that will be moved into your Pages hosting location.
